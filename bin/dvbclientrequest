#  dvbondemand
#
#  Gets audio/video services from several dvb cards.
#  Starts mumudvb servers on client's request.
#  Stops these servers when idle.
#
#  dvbondemand detects when a service is required and therefore
#  starts mumudvb sessions using an available dvb adapter.
#  In few seconds clients will get the corresponding http video/audio stream.
#  Also, ends the mumudvb server session after client disconnection.
