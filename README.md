# DvbOnDemand

Gets audio/video services from several dvb cards.

Starts MuMuDVB servers on client's request.

Stops these servers when idle.

dvbondemand detects when a service is required and therefore
starts mumudvb sessions using an available dvb adapter.

In few seconds clients will get the corresponding http video/audio stream.

Also, ends the mumudvb server session after client disconnection.
